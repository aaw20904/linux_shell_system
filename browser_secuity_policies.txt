<< Content-Security-Policy  >>
This header allows execute scripts from domains, that has been included in this HTTP header.
. The security layer helps mitigate attackers from taking advantage of vulnerabilities like
cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks. Folr example, tere is a header below:
      'Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only', 
      "default-src 'self'; 
      script-src 'self' https://code.jquery.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com ; 
      style-src 'self' https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com; 
      font-src 'self' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com;
      img-src 'self'; 
      frame-src 'self'"
      
 <<  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy  >>
  The HTTP Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) response header allows you to ensure a top-level
  document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents.
  COOP will process-isolate your document and potential attackers can't access your global 
  object if they were to open it in a popup, preventing a set of cross-origin attacks dubbed XS-Leaks    
  There are three variants:
          -------"Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: unsafe-none"  ------
          This is the default value. Allows the document to be added to its opener's browsing 
          context group unless the opener itself has a COOP of 
          same-origin or same-origin-allow-popups.
          -------"Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups"-------
          Retains references to newly opened windows or tabs that either don't set COOP or that
          opt out of isolation by setting a COOP of unsafe-none.
          -------"Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin"-----------
          Isolates the browsing context exclusively to same-origin documents. 
          Cross-origin documents are not loaded in the same browsing context.
    
    
  <<  Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy  >>
  The HTTP Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy response header conveys a desire that the browser blocks
  no-cors cross-origin/cross-site requests to the given resource. There ar three values:
     "Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-site | same-origin | cross-origin"
