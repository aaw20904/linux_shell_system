TLS handshake
1)Client send 'ClientHello' to the server
  THe one contains:
     a)SSL or TLS version
     b)Supported cryptographic algorythms by a client
     c)data compressed method supported by a client  
2) THe server responded by 'ServerHello' with:
     a)A cryptoghaphic protolol which a server had chousen from a list of the client
     b)Session ID
     c)Server`s certificate
     d)A certificate`s public key
3) THe Client confirming a digital certificate in centers of certification
4)When a cert is valid - a client encrypt a <<shared sectret key>> by the server`s public key
   and send to the server.
5)A client send a 'Finished' message- it encrypted  by a <<shared secret key>>.
6)A server responded - send a 'Finished' message encrypted my <<shared secret key>>.
 NOW  a client and a server can communicated each with other using a symmetric  shared secret key
