1) USB Stack (Device & Host Side)

‚úî Very valuable for embedded jobs.

    Many STM32, ESP32, or ARM-based devices need USB CDC, HID, MSC, or Audio.

    Few firmware engineers truly understand USB descriptors and enumeration ‚Äì it will make you stand out.

    Even with a USB 1.1 logic analyzer, you can learn enumeration, handshakes, and endpoints, which is enough to understand the protocol fundamentals.
2) TCP/UDP + DHCP, ARP, RARP, DNS

‚úî Critical for IoT and Industrial Embedded Systems.

    If you know how Ethernet/Wi-Fi stacks actually work, you can develop or debug lwIP or other lightweight stacks on STM32/ESP32.

    DHCP, ARP, DNS are the basics for any networked device ‚Äì very relevant for IoT products, industrial controllers, or networked measurement systems.

3) Linux (System & Network Programming)

‚úî A must for higher-level embedded and remote jobs.

    Many remote embedded jobs are for Linux-based systems (ARM SBCs, routers, IoT gateways), not only bare-metal MCUs.

    Knowing Linux socket API, daemons, processes, and device drivers will allow you to work on higher-paying positions (e.g., ‚ÄúEmbedded Linux Engineer‚Äù).

    Also, you‚Äôll be able to write diagnostic tools and custom daemons for your devices.
