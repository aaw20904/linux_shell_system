An entity in a database is a thing, place, person or object that is independent of another.
An entity is uniquely identifiable.
***
Union (∪): The union operation combines tuples from two relations and returns a new relation
that contains all the tuples from both relations, eliminating any duplicate tuples.
The two relations involved in the union operation must have the same attribute structure 
(same number of attributes and compatible types).

Intersection (∩): The intersection operation compares two relations and returns a
new relation that contains only the tuples that appear in
both relations. In other words, it selects the common tuples shared by
both relations. Again, the two relations must have the same attribute structure.

Difference (−): The difference operation compares two relations and returns a new
relation that contains the tuples that appear in the first relation but not in the second relation. 
It removes the tuples that are common to both relations. Like with union and intersection,
the two relations must have the same attribute structure.

Keys of Relations

We say a set of one or more attributes { A i,A 2 , ... , An} is a key for a relation
R if:
1. Those attributes functionally determine all other attributes of the relation.
That is, it is impossible for two distinct tuples of R to agree on all
of A i , A 2 , . . . , A n.
2. No proper subset of { A i,A 2 , . . . , A n} functionally determines all other
attributes of R; i.e., a key must be minimal.
When a key consists of a single attribute A, we often say that A (rather than
{A}) is a key.
